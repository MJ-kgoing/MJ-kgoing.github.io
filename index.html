<p>This course of the psychology department of Yale University is known as one of the most popular course in the university that there are more than 500 students attending every time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a course about thinking and reasoning using psychology, and will also discuss how can you improve your thinking skills. Covered topics include judgment and decision making, causal learning, logical reasoning, problem solving, creativity, intelligence, moral reasoning, and language and thought.</p>
<p>I wish this course can bring actual help and change to students’ daily life.</p>
<p> —— Professor Woo-Kyoung Ahn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one I attended this time is only a 4 x 90min session of the course which is splitted into two days, covering behavioral economics, self-concept, planning and optimism bias, thinking about others and fake news.</p>
<p>The course is introduced by the Yale Center Beijing institution and is taught online due to the Covid-19.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor of Psychology</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ph.D., 1990, University of Illinois</p>
<p>My main area of research interest is higher-level reasoning processes. In particular, I study how people learn and represent concepts and causal relations, and how causal explanations shape our thinking processes. I study basic cognitive processes underlying concept and causal learning. I also study applied issues, such as how expert clinicians’ causal explanations for mental disorders affect their diagnoses, and how learning about one’s genetic predisposition affects people’s expectations about their symptoms.</p>
<p>—— Department of Psychology of Yale University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After attended the course I would say Professor Ahn is a lecturer who is experienced, amiable, and is good at conveying informations in an easily understandable way. Her lectures are very informative but also interactive as there are many quizes and polls that keep us engaged. Another thing I really appreciate is the relaxing atmosphere Prof. Ahn creates in her class that she constantly use light tones while speaking and put entertaining video clips between concepts.</p>

<li><p><strong><u>What are the concepts that are memorable to me?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winning 1 million or loss your legs doesn’t really make a difference on life satisfaction according to Focusing  Illusion.</li>
<li>We got to be chill more, being too rational isn’t always a good thing.</li>
<li>It is possible for us to believe we are above the average while feeling insecure due to the Above Average Effect and the high standard we set for ourselves.</li>
<li>We often estimate a shorter time than the actual time we need to complete a task which is know as the Planning Fallacy. In addition, making a detailed plan wouldn’t help but do the the opposite. However, using a 3rd person perspective would help us to focus more on the obsticles more instead of believing things will go smoothly.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong><u>What are the concepts that are memorable to me?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t really help when you put yourself into others’ shoes in order to understand their opinion better, therefore the best way to know what people are thinking is to ask them directly.</li>
<li>It seems that because Eastern people are collective rather than idividualistic, they tend to be better at considering others’ perspective.</li>
<li>Even children’s memory can be changed by themselves with or without leading questions, and there are cases in the world in which innocent people are accused to be child abuser with the the unrealistic memory kids have.</li>
<li>Simply by repeating a statement we can make others believe in it, even when the statement is not true.</li>
<li>It is important to check whether the resources you are using have a fake consensus.</li>
<li>Denying the fake news is not enough, the best way to eliminate a fake news is to prove it wrong and replace it with a correct information.</li>

<li><p><u>Psychology is a branch of science</u></p>
<p>During the course, especially on the Behavioral Economic section, a lot of calculation were done in order to support the theory and visualize the concept. Maths and the ability to analyze data are also required in designing and evaluating experiments. In other words, all the conclusion we got about human’s mind are the production of rational calculation and analysis. This enhanced my idea on working hard on those skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>Lecture is very different from regular classes in school</u></p>
<p>This is my first time to attend a lecture given by an actual professor from university, therefore it took me sometime to adapt to the rhythm of the course. In this lecture the professor went through the concepts in a relatively fast speed which was different from the teachers in school who would stop and answer questions during class. Consequently, I found some difficult in taking notes as I was not sure whether I should just focus on what the professor was talking or taking note at the same time. If I did the latter, then which were the important part that I needed to write down with the limited time. I believe these are the questions I need to answer in order to have a better experience for the next similar situation in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><u>It is always useful to learn some psychology</u></p>
<p>Psychology can help you understand the relationship between the individual and the society, yourself and others better, thus save your time from thinking too much about your social life or other situations happen aroung you. Psychology also helps you to think and evaluate critically, which are the abilities required basically in every field.</p>

<p>The “should be” thinking mode is a way of thinking that has the essence of rejecting the real world, which we try to make it surrender to the existing rules in our mind, and expressing emotions like anxiety, anger, or depress when the world doesn’t obey to those rules. There are two types of “should be” thinking mode: one is for the world and one is for ourselves. This talk mainly focuses on the latter.</p>

<li><p><u>Examples given for explanation.</u></p>
<p>The author has a friend who just realized it was the time to be hardworking, therefore he sleeps 6 hours only per day even during weekend and tries his best to learn something new. However, altough he feels awesome while studying, every time his productivity decreases, what he feels instead is dispirition. This gives him an ambivalent emotion that he feels working so hard is not worthy but he would be a looser if he gives up as there are people working even harder. </p>
<p>The author pointed out that the cause of this contradicting emotion is the “should be” thinking of “I should be hard working”. Naturally, striving occurs when people have a goal and they work actively toward it. However, hard-working without a goal would just be the copy version of the real one as we only know it is the right thing to do instead of what we really want to succeed. It seems that we are staying up late, listening to lectures and doing extra work, but what these compose is only the status of “working hard”.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></p>
<p>There has been a period of time that I feel overwelmed and extremely fatigued, and, anxiety. Everyday, I felt that there were countless tasks to be finished as you can always do extra. For example, if I finished today’s homework, I would think about completing tomorrow’s and revise and review and… I believed I was hardworking as I was like a spinning top everyday. However, on the other hand I feel no accomplishment or improve but just fatigue and anxiety. I liked the status of working hard as it made me feel I was going forward, but I was also doubting myself and the meaning of all of these. I was really puzzled. After listening to this talk, I think I found the answer. I should have a clearer goal, which would tell me what should I do. In addition, I should find the way of study which is suitable for me. Nobody says you have to stay up if you want to success. Listening to your heart and stop mimicing those “you should” statements the world is instilling to you. Let yourself pause for a while, take a breathe and think. Don’t be hurry, all roads lead to Rome.</p>

            <p>It is almost terrifying to come to realize how many Python classes I have already had until this moment when I’m typing down these words. Today, we officially started our learning journal of Pandas. Before that, we have been through Python and Numpy which is the foundation of the language and the basic of the data analyzing part of Python. </p>
<p>​                   [<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83zNhq.md.png" alt="83zNhq.md.png"></p>
<p>​    </p>
<p>The beginning of the learning was really fun as I’m always attracted to new things. However, with the start of a school semester and the increasing difficulty of the course, I started to feel slightly off the track and hard to catch up with the class. Luckily, we began learning Numpy shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t fully understand the purpose for me to learn coding as I thought my interested field—psychology—does not require such skill. However, after numerous examples were given on the importance of data analysis, I paid more attention to the content.</p>
<p>Although Numpy has a connection with the previous learning, it was still sometimes difficult to understand certain idea like the “broadcasting”. Except that, it was fresh to see how lines of code can be turned in to graphs according to the uploaded datas.</p>
<p>​                                                       <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83zYAs.jpg" alt="83zYAs.jpg"></p>
<p>​                                      <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/83ztNn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83ztNn.png" alt="83ztNn.png"></a></p>
<p>Talking about Pandas which is what we just started, I feel that it is an aspect of Python that is more useful, easy to learn, and doesn’t give me much pressure to catch on. However, I still think I should spend more extra time out of class on typing the codes and reviewing the knowledge, which I believe one day would help me while I’m actually practicing them.</p>

<p><em>Iget (得到) - an Chinese app that contains original audio courses on different subjects, teaching by expers and professionists.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Course taking: The psychology of self-developing.</em> (自我发展心理学)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>About The Course</strong></p>
<p>This course is not an real branch of psychology but an original and fresh learning subject that the giver has extracted from real life and his 12 years experience of being a therapist. The course giver believes that the users of Iget are all ambitious and eager for advancement, but he also found that the majority are experiencing the hardship of breaking through their comfort zone and making actural changes. Therefore, he created this course about changing. This is also why we chose it to start with. As it is reality-based, a lot of connection will be made.</p>
<p><strong>About This Talk ( 02 | The Essence of Changes：How to Create New Experiences)</strong></p>
<p>This talk has two parts: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Psychology system that hinders us from making changes</u></p>
<p>The lecturer metioned the Jonathon・Haidt’s theory of describing our emotional and rational selfs as an selfish elephant and a clam elephant rider. The elephant is powerful, emotional, and most importantly, it’s experience-driven. This theory help me to understands that although we can imagine the benefits changes can bring to us - for instance, becoming more efficent if we stop procrastinating -, we still involuntarily choose to watch youtube as we have often experienced the joy it gives but not from being efficient. The elephant always pick the “benefits of experience” instead of the “benefits of expecting.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>How to take the first step</u></p>
<p>Using an example, the course giver suggests that, the essence of changing is the process of creating new experience and replacing the old ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only have the expectation in your imagination but not new experiences that are gained from new behaviors, changes are barely possible to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Well I would say I feel particularly connected to the content of this talk as I linked it to my experience of loosing weight. It is said that “weight losing is a life-long job of girls”, and I’m certainly one of them. I’ve been trying to get rid of my fat for several times but they all ended up with failure. On one side, I can clearly imagine the benefits of being in a good shape and I know that is exactly what I pursue. However, on the other side, I also can’t reject the feeling of craving food and eat what I like while I know I shouldn’t. Evertime when I’m facing the “junk foods”, there’s a battle between the elephant and the rider stating in my mind. They both win sometimes, but I still feel unsatisfied or regret afterward. This is a problem that I’ve been facing for a long time, and I hope the course can give me the answer. </p>

            <p>I just had my <u>third</u> python class and we were still talking about the List. The reason I’m now writing this blog is because for the first time, I have been in the “flow” that I truly and completely sink in to the process of creating code, finding errors and trying to fix it. This was led by an after-class homework assigned to us for this class that we were asked to create a program which contains certain functions. </p>
<hr>
<p>I used around 20 minutes to figure it out and submit the first version. However, it was imperfect according to the teacher and he gave me some advices for improvement. Unfortunately, I failed to create the right program after numerous tries. During this process, I have been adjusting different part of the program while checking the content in the textbook. When these didn’t work, I seeked out for help.</p>
<p>​                                                                <em>(class discussion)</em> </p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/16p16U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/02/06/16p16U.md.png" alt="16p16U.md.png"></a></p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a lot of my classmates were enfacing the same problem as I. Consequently we started a class discussion even when it was already an hour later the end of class. Our teacher also joined after a while and with his aid I addresses the problem quickly and I was genuinely  happy when I saw the expected output. I then shared my result in the chat and tried to answer questions from others. I was so into the process of solving problem that I didn’t even realize the pass of time. </p>
<p>​                                        <em>(the program we were trying to building)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/16pllT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/02/06/16pllT.md.jpg" alt="16pllT.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now, I can understand why there are tons of internet worker who are willing to spend their whole day staring at their screen just for solving the bug. I can now admit, that coding is <strong>addictive</strong>. It is <strong>interesting</strong> and I wish it would be my new interest to establish further.</p>
