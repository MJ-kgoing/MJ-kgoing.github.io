<p><strong>About This Talk ( 14 | The “Should Be” Thinking Mode Toward Yourself: Why Can’t You Accept Your Emotions? )</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>“Should be” thinking mode</u></p>
<p>The “should be” thinking mode is a way of thinking that has the essence of rejecting the real world, which we try to make it surrender to the existing rules in our mind, and expressing emotions like anxiety, anger, or depress when the world doesn’t obey to those rules. There are two types of “should be” thinking mode: one is for the world and one is for ourselves. This talk mainly focuses on the latter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>Examples given for explanation.</u></p>
<p>The author has a friend who just realized it was the time to be hardworking, therefore he sleeps 6 hours only per day even during weekend and tries his best to learn something new. However, altough he feels awesome while studying, every time his productivity decreases, what he feels instead is dispirition. This gives him an ambivalent emotion that he feels working so hard is not worthy but he would be a looser if he gives up as there are people working even harder. </p>
<p>The author pointed out that the cause of this contradicting emotion is the “should be” thinking of “I should be hard working”. Naturally, striving occurs when people have a goal and they work actively toward it. However, hard-working without a goal would just be the copy version of the real one as we only know it is the right thing to do instead of what we really want to succeed. It seems that we are staying up late, listening to lectures and doing extra work, but what these compose is only the status of “working hard”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></p>
<p>There has been a period of time that I feel overwelmed and extremely fatigued, and, anxiety. Everyday, I felt that there were countless tasks to be finished as you can always do extra. For example, if I finished today’s homework, I would think about completing tomorrow’s and revise and review and… I believed I was hardworking as I was like a spinning top everyday. However, on the other hand I feel no accomplishment or improve but just fatigue and anxiety. I liked the status of working hard as it made me feel I was going forward, but I was also doubting myself and the meaning of all of these. I was really puzzled. After listening to this talk, I think I found the answer. I should have a clearer goal, which would tell me what should I do. In addition, I should find the way of study which is suitable for me. Nobody says you have to stay up if you want to success. Listening to your heart and stop mimicing those “you should” statements the world is instilling to you. Let yourself pause for a while, take a breathe and think. Don’t be hurry, all roads lead to Rome.</p>

            <p>It is almost terrifying to come to realize how many Python classes I have already had until this moment when I’m typing down these words. Today, we officially started our learning journal of Pandas. Before that, we have been through Python and Numpy which is the foundation of the language and the basic of the data analyzing part of Python. </p>
<p>​                   [<img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83zNhq.md.png" alt="83zNhq.md.png"></p>
<p>​    </p>
<p>The beginning of the learning was really fun as I’m always attracted to new things. However, with the start of a school semester and the increasing difficulty of the course, I started to feel slightly off the track and hard to catch up with the class. Luckily, we began learning Numpy shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t fully understand the purpose for me to learn coding as I thought my interested field—psychology—does not require such skill. However, after numerous examples were given on the importance of data analysis, I paid more attention to the content.</p>
<p>Although Numpy has a connection with the previous learning, it was still sometimes difficult to understand certain idea like the “broadcasting”. Except that, it was fresh to see how lines of code can be turned in to graphs according to the uploaded datas.</p>
<p>​                                                       <img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83zYAs.jpg" alt="83zYAs.jpg"></p>
<p>​                                      <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/83ztNn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/15/83ztNn.png" alt="83ztNn.png"></a></p>
<p>Talking about Pandas which is what we just started, I feel that it is an aspect of Python that is more useful, easy to learn, and doesn’t give me much pressure to catch on. However, I still think I should spend more extra time out of class on typing the codes and reviewing the knowledge, which I believe one day would help me while I’m actually practicing them.</p>

<p><em>Course taking: The psychology of self-developing.</em> (自我发展心理学)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>About The Course</strong></p>
<p>This course is not an real branch of psychology but an original and fresh learning subject that the giver has extracted from real life and his 12 years experience of being a therapist. The course giver believes that the users of Iget are all ambitious and eager for advancement, but he also found that the majority are experiencing the hardship of breaking through their comfort zone and making actural changes. Therefore, he created this course about changing. This is also why we chose it to start with. As it is reality-based, a lot of connection will be made.</p>
<p><strong>About This Talk ( 02 | The Essence of Changes：How to Create New Experiences)</strong></p>
<p>This talk has two parts: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Psychology system that hinders us from making changes</u></p>
<p>The lecturer metioned the Jonathon・Haidt’s theory of describing our emotional and rational selfs as an selfish elephant and a clam elephant rider. The elephant is powerful, emotional, and most importantly, it’s experience-driven. This theory help me to understands that although we can imagine the benefits changes can bring to us - for instance, becoming more efficent if we stop procrastinating -, we still involuntarily choose to watch youtube as we have often experienced the joy it gives but not from being efficient. The elephant always pick the “benefits of experience” instead of the “benefits of expecting.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>How to take the first step</u></p>
<p>Using an example, the course giver suggests that, the essence of changing is the process of creating new experience and replacing the old ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only have the expectation in your imagination but not new experiences that are gained from new behaviors, changes are barely possible to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Well I would say I feel particularly connected to the content of this talk as I linked it to my experience of loosing weight. It is said that “weight losing is a life-long job of girls”, and I’m certainly one of them. I’ve been trying to get rid of my fat for several times but they all ended up with failure. On one side, I can clearly imagine the benefits of being in a good shape and I know that is exactly what I pursue. However, on the other side, I also can’t reject the feeling of craving food and eat what I like while I know I shouldn’t. Evertime when I’m facing the “junk foods”, there’s a battle between the elephant and the rider stating in my mind. They both win sometimes, but I still feel unsatisfied or regret afterward. This is a problem that I’ve been facing for a long time, and I hope the course can give me the answer. </p>

            <p>I just had my <u>third</u> python class and we were still talking about the List. The reason I’m now writing this blog is because for the first time, I have been in the “flow” that I truly and completely sink in to the process of creating code, finding errors and trying to fix it. This was led by an after-class homework assigned to us for this class that we were asked to create a program which contains certain functions. </p>
<hr>
<p>I used around 20 minutes to figure it out and submit the first version. However, it was imperfect according to the teacher and he gave me some advices for improvement. Unfortunately, I failed to create the right program after numerous tries. During this process, I have been adjusting different part of the program while checking the content in the textbook. When these didn’t work, I seeked out for help.</p>
<p>​                                                                <em>(class discussion)</em> </p>

<p>Unexpectedly, a lot of my classmates were enfacing the same problem as I. Consequently we started a class discussion even when it was already an hour later the end of class. Our teacher also joined after a while and with his aid I addresses the problem quickly and I was genuinely  happy when I saw the expected output. I then shared my result in the chat and tried to answer questions from others. I was so into the process of solving problem that I didn’t even realize the pass of time. </p>

<p>Now, I can understand why there are tons of internet worker who are willing to spend their whole day staring at their screen just for solving the bug. I can now admit, that coding is <strong>addictive</strong>. It is <strong>interesting</strong> and I wish it would be my new interest to establish further.</p>

            <p>I just had my first Python online class and I just want to quickly record this as believe the journey of learning this new coding language will be playing a pivotal role in my future learning.</p>
<h4 id="How-I-felt-before-class"><a href="#How-I-felt-before-class" class="headerlink" title="How I felt before class:"></a>How I felt before class:</h4><p>I wouldn’t say I’m an experienced code writer nor a beginner. Yes, I do have experience which I gained from the previous digital design/computer science classes in school but as I am not a technology enthusiasm, I didn’t input other time outside of class. Hence, I felt ensure about my ability on entering the course even after the research I did that told me Python is a language with low threshold and accessible, especially when the class has already reached chapter 4 according to the textbook. However, as this is a new experience of learning to me, curiosity and freshness have also been taken to the class.</p>
<h4 id="What-we-learned-in-class"><a href="#What-we-learned-in-class" class="headerlink" title="What we learned in class:"></a>What we learned in class:</h4><p>This class covered all the content of the usage lists, including the list data type, the index, getting a list’s length, etc.</p>

<h4 id="How-I-felt-after-class"><a href="#How-I-felt-after-class" class="headerlink" title="How I felt after class:"></a>How I felt after class:</h4><p>The first sensation I have is the feeling of proud. I was proud of myself because I found myself being able to catch up with the class, understanding the concept, and outputting them on my laptop. This plus the compliment I received in class gave me motivation to do further exploration on coding. Beside, I seem to sense the fun part of coding and I wish this feeling would increase in the future with the progress of my study.</p>
<p>My current plan and goal is to focus on building the understanding of the foundation of Python by re-taking my missed class of chapter 1-3. Extracting information from the lessons maximumly in order to pave a better road for future learning. </p>
