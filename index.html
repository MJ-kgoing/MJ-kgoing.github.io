            <h4 id="What-is-this-project-about"><a href="#What-is-this-project-about" class="headerlink" title="What is this project about"></a>What is this project about</h4><p>This is a partner project I completed in the school Computer Science class. We could choose from multiple projects based on the description given, and the challenge we did is called “Mini Gene Finder”, here is a brief introduction to the project that I wrote for the documentary part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The protein synthesis process is known as the central dogma of biology, in which transcription(transcribing the antisense strand of a gene to the mRNA strand)  and translation(translating the mRNA into the genetic code of protein) takes place in order to decode the “recipe” of protein which is stored in the DNA. In this study, we aim to create a program that can model these two steps while also verifying whether the amino acid is valid by testing it with some basic rules. The target audience of this program is potentially the biologists who seek an efficient and accurate way to decode the protein synthesis process. The tool that will be used in this program is Repl.it which is a platform for share and build codes.”</p>
<p>Sample output: <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/slCz7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/10/slCz7D.md.png" alt="slCz7D.md.png"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="What-was-the-process"><a href="#What-was-the-process" class="headerlink" title="What was the process"></a>What was the process</h4><p>The project is divided into 3 criterias: B, C, and D:</p>
<p>Criteria B:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difining the problem</li>
<li>Identify design specifications,</li>
<li>Break down the big program</li>
<li>Concieve and evaluate a design plan (pseudocode/ flowchart) </li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create schedule for building codes and evaluate</li>
<li>Actual program writing</li>
<li>Highlight parts of the code that demonstrates a high level of technical skill</li>
</ul>
<p>Criteria D:</p>
<ul>
<li>Present solution through screencast</li>
<li>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution and suggest possible improvement</li>
<li>Evaluation on self contribution and achievements.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="The-code"><a href="#The-code" class="headerlink" title="The code"></a>The code</h4><p>Here are part of the codes we wrote:</p>

            <p>Starting from year 11, more and more students led extra curricular activities including services and clubs pop out. For me, I already joined the school magazine contributing as a chinese writer, an economy club founded by my friends and a service that teach refugee kids to dance. In addition, my friends and I are also planing to start an art club that connect with both the school community and the society. However, I still found no perfect psychology related organization for me to attend. Therefore the idea of starting my own psychology club begins hovering in my mind. </p>
<p>When that idea appears, my immediately contacts my friend who I know share the same interest with me. Not surprisingly she has the same thought. We both think that, now is the perfect time to start a psychology club as it is what missing in the school. However, we are also puzzled by the format of the club should be in. Should it be academic purpose in terms of helping IB psychology students with their school work or teaching amateur psychological concepts? Or, should it be survey and research base that surves for the school education and the well-being of the students? These are the question we are considering lately. Therefore, we decides to each do some research on the common activities a school psychology club held and if necessary we will contact the Psychology subject teachers in our school in the effort of gaining support and future cooperation.</p>
<p>I’m personally very passioned about this idea because I believe that forming a club not only improve my organization skills and leadership but also strengthen the incentive for me to continue explore the field as as a leader I need abundant knowledge to back my position. </p>
<p>Looking forward to the progress :)</p>

            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>It is a summer program that allows students to work with professors from people’s dreaming colleges and research on subjects they are passionated about. The topic I chose was Personality Psychology, led by professor Zayas from Cornell University. 20 students were divided into the moring and evening sessions however we will gather together for our final project. The course begins with the knowledging learning section then progresses into the researching part and there is a chance for the final papers to be published.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I attend it?</strong></p>
<p>There are mainly two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Obtain knowledge and research skills</u></p>
<p>Personality is always fascinating me who is a big fan of horoscope and trait tests (and I always think they are fairly accurate until I learn about the Baren Effect.) Therefore I would love to see what really is “personality”, how we develop it and what are some studies about it. However, what in my perspective is more valuable are the research skills, including choosing topics, reading papers, creating questionair, etc. I believe they will be the core abilities required in my future studying.</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Learn from excellent professors and peers</u></p>
<p>I wish I can learn from the experience of those who are older than me and expand my social circle. In addition, I wish to form a good relationship with the professor who studies the subject that I might research on in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What have I obtained from it so far?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Knowledge</u></p>
<p>During the past 4 weeks we have discussed numerous topics including the defiition of personality, research methods, traits, biology and much more.The content is truly abundant that every time I review the lecture slides I learn something new. One thing that really interests me are the attachment styles as it is a topic I’ve been paying attention to. Therefore I’m looking foward to next week’s classes which will focus on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Friendship</u></p>
<p>Although it only has been 4 weeks but I believe a very friendly and comfortable relationship is formed between every one including the professor and the TA. Most of the students are slightly older than me therefore they often provide me with deliberate answers to my questions, beside everyone is nice and funny to talk to. It is genuienly a pleasure to meet them</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What will I be doing?</strong></p>
<p>This week we decided on one of the three topic and are seperated into three different groups based on the topic. We also began to read some papers on that subject which is actually challenging as some of them have more than 40 pages. Next week we will be reviewing the study and collecting data. </p>

            <blockquote>
<p> As my summer vocation just started, I plan to use this time to research on some topics that I’m interested in or maybe start up some projects, and the first step to begin is brainstorming and write whatever in my mind down:</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="The-Spread-of-Worldwide-Protests"><a href="#The-Spread-of-Worldwide-Protests" class="headerlink" title="The Spread of Worldwide Protests."></a>The Spread of Worldwide Protests.</h4><p>Recently, the death of George Floyd has triggered demonstrations and protests in more than 75 U.S. cities and around the world against police brutality, police racism, and lack of police accountability, implying the oppressed emotions of the rasicm sufferers and protestors. I’m interested in this event because I really wonder why would the death of a single man strike such a powerful chord that stimulates so many people to gather together, even during the pandemic. To go further on that quesiton I might need to do more research on Crowd psychology or sociology, or maybe the thing isn’t that complicated. </p>
<h4 id="Anxiety-and-Emotions-Expressing"><a href="#Anxiety-and-Emotions-Expressing" class="headerlink" title="Anxiety and Emotions Expressing"></a>Anxiety and Emotions Expressing</h4><p>Since the start the pandemic, my dad has been in an unstable emotions mostly because he started to speculate in the stock market and didn’t get an favorable outcome. He spent already too much time and effort in it and was not willing to ask for professional advices, making himself really anxious and stressed. Therefore, I would like to find a suitable way to ease his stress and persuade him to try more things out in his life as he doesn’t normally do so. </p>
<h4 id="Establishing-a-Small-Society-in-A-Nursing-Home"><a href="#Establishing-a-Small-Society-in-A-Nursing-Home" class="headerlink" title="Establishing a Small Society in A Nursing Home."></a>Establishing a Small Society in A Nursing Home.</h4><p>I recently watched a video about a Japanese nursing house where they release their own curency and establish a series of “society rules” for the old people to earn “money”. They even create small gambling games as it somehow decrease the their chance of getting Alzheimer’s disease. These succefully help the old people to find their value again and make them feel that they are not disconnected with the society. I don’t know if it’s possible to try this in one of the HK nursing home, but I think it would be really interesting and helpful. However, I definitely need to do some field trip and research to determine the practicity of this  idea.</p>

<p>This course of the psychology department of Yale University is known as one of the most popular course in the university that there are more than 500 students attending every time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a course about thinking and reasoning using psychology, and will also discuss how can you improve your thinking skills. Covered topics include judgment and decision making, causal learning, logical reasoning, problem solving, creativity, intelligence, moral reasoning, and language and thought.</p>
<p>I wish this course can bring actual help and change to students’ daily life.</p>
<p> —— Professor Woo-Kyoung Ahn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one I attended this time is only a 4 x 90min session of the course which is splitted into two days, covering behavioral economics, self-concept, planning and optimism bias, thinking about others and fake news.</p>
<p>The course is introduced by the Yale Center Beijing institution and is taught online due to the Covid-19.</p>

<p>Professor of Psychology</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ph.D., 1990, University of Illinois</p>
<p>My main area of research interest is higher-level reasoning processes. In particular, I study how people learn and represent concepts and causal relations, and how causal explanations shape our thinking processes. I study basic cognitive processes underlying concept and causal learning. I also study applied issues, such as how expert clinicians’ causal explanations for mental disorders affect their diagnoses, and how learning about one’s genetic predisposition affects people’s expectations about their symptoms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>After attended the course I would say Professor Ahn is a lecturer who is experienced, amiable, and is good at conveying informations in an easily understandable way. Her lectures are very informative but also interactive as there are many quizes and polls that keep us engaged. Another thing I really appreciate is the relaxing atmosphere Prof. Ahn creates in her class that she constantly use light tones while speaking and put entertaining video clips between concepts.</p>

<li>It is possible for us to believe we are above the average while feeling insecure due to the Above Average Effect and the high standard we set for ourselves.</li>
<li>We often estimate a shorter time than the actual time we need to complete a task which is know as the Planning Fallacy. In addition, making a detailed plan wouldn’t help but do the the opposite. However, using a 3rd person perspective would help us to focus more on the obsticles more instead of believing things will go smoothly.</li>

<li>It seems that because Eastern people are collective rather than idividualistic, they tend to be better at considering others’ perspective.</li>
<li>Even children’s memory can be changed by themselves with or without leading questions, and there are cases in the world in which innocent people are accused to be child abuser with the the unrealistic memory kids have.</li>
<li>Simply by repeating a statement we can make others believe in it, even when the statement is not true.</li>
<li>It is important to check whether the resources you are using have a fake consensus.</li>
<li>Denying the fake news is not enough, the best way to eliminate a fake news is to prove it wrong and replace it with a correct information.</li>

<li><p><u>Psychology is a branch of science</u></p>
<p>During the course, especially on the Behavioral Economic section, a lot of calculation were done in order to support the theory and visualize the concept. Maths and the ability to analyze data are also required in designing and evaluating experiments. In other words, all the conclusion we got about human’s mind are the production of rational calculation and analysis. This enhanced my idea on working hard on those skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>Lecture is very different from regular classes in school</u></p>
<p>This is my first time to attend a lecture given by an actual professor from university, therefore it took me sometime to adapt to the rhythm of the course. In this lecture the professor went through the concepts in a relatively fast speed which was different from the teachers in school who would stop and answer questions during class. Consequently, I found some difficult in taking notes as I was not sure whether I should just focus on what the professor was talking or taking note at the same time. If I did the latter, then which were the important part that I needed to write down with the limited time. I believe these are the questions I need to answer in order to have a better experience for the next similar situation in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><u>It is always useful to learn some psychology</u></p>
<p>Psychology can help you understand the relationship between the individual and the society, yourself and others better, thus save your time from thinking too much about your social life or other situations happen aroung you. Psychology also helps you to think and evaluate critically, which are the abilities required basically in every field.</p>

<p><strong>About This Talk ( 14 | The “Should Be” Thinking Mode Toward Yourself: Why Can’t You Accept Your Emotions? )</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>“Should be” thinking mode</u></p>
<p>The “should be” thinking mode is a way of thinking that has the essence of rejecting the real world, which we try to make it surrender to the existing rules in our mind, and expressing emotions like anxiety, anger, or depress when the world doesn’t obey to those rules. There are two types of “should be” thinking mode: one is for the world and one is for ourselves. This talk mainly focuses on the latter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>Examples given for explanation.</u></p>
<p>The author has a friend who just realized it was the time to be hardworking, therefore he sleeps 6 hours only per day even during weekend and tries his best to learn something new. However, altough he feels awesome while studying, every time his productivity decreases, what he feels instead is dispirition. This gives him an ambivalent emotion that he feels working so hard is not worthy but he would be a looser if he gives up as there are people working even harder. </p>
<p>The author pointed out that the cause of this contradicting emotion is the “should be” thinking of “I should be hard working”. Naturally, striving occurs when people have a goal and they work actively toward it. However, hard-working without a goal would just be the copy version of the real one as we only know it is the right thing to do instead of what we really want to succeed. It seems that we are staying up late, listening to lectures and doing extra work, but what these compose is only the status of “working hard”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></p>
<p>There has been a period of time that I feel overwelmed and extremely fatigued, and, anxiety. Everyday, I felt that there were countless tasks to be finished as you can always do extra. For example, if I finished today’s homework, I would think about completing tomorrow’s and revise and review and… I believed I was hardworking as I was like a spinning top everyday. However, on the other hand I feel no accomplishment or improve but just fatigue and anxiety. I liked the status of working hard as it made me feel I was going forward, but I was also doubting myself and the meaning of all of these. I was really puzzled. After listening to this talk, I think I found the answer. I should have a clearer goal, which would tell me what should I do. In addition, I should find the way of study which is suitable for me. Nobody says you have to stay up if you want to success. Listening to your heart and stop mimicing those “you should” statements the world is instilling to you. Let yourself pause for a while, take a breathe and think. Don’t be hurry, all roads lead to Rome.</p>
