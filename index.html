            <blockquote>
<p><em>Iget (得到) - an Chinese app that contains original audio courses on different subjects, teaching by expers and professionists.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Course taking: The psychology of self-developing.</em> (自我发展心理学)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>About The Course</strong></p>
<p>This course is not an real branch of psychology but an original and fresh learning subject that the giver has extracted from real life and his 12 years experience of being a therapist. The course giver believes that the users of Iget are all ambitious and eager for advancement, but he also found that the majority are experiencing the hardship of breaking through their comfort zone and making actural changes. Therefore, he created this course about changing. This is also why we chose it to start with. As it is reality-based, a lot of connection will be made.</p>
<p><strong>About This Talk ( 02 | The Essence of Changes：How to Create New Experiences)</strong></p>
<p>This talk has two parts: </p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Psychology system that hinders us from making changes</u></p>
<p>The lecturer metioned the Jonathon・Haidt’s theory of describing our emotional and rational selfs as an selfish elephant and a clam elephant rider. The elephant is powerful, emotional, and most importantly, it’s experience-driven. This theory help me to understands that although we can imagine the benefits changes can bring to us - for instance, becoming more efficent if we stop procrastinating -, we still involuntarily choose to watch youtube as we have often experienced the joy it gives but not from being efficient. The elephant always pick the “benefits of experience” instead of the “benefits of expecting.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>How to take the first step</u></p>
<p>Using an example, the course giver suggests that, the essence of changing is the process of creating new experience and replacing the old ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only have the expectation in your imagination but not new experiences that are gained from new behaviors, changes are barely possible to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Well I would say I feel particularly connected to the content of this talk as I linked it to my experience of loosing weight. It is said that “weight losing is a life-long job of girls”, and I’m certainly one of them. I’ve been trying to get rid of my fat for several times but they all ended up with failure. On one side, I can clearly imagine the benefits of being in a good shape and I know that is exactly what I pursue. However, on the other side, I also can’t reject the feeling of craving food and eat what I like while I know I shouldn’t. Evertime when I’m facing the “junk foods”, there’s a battle between the elephant and the rider stating in my mind. They both win sometimes, but I still feel unsatisfied or regret afterward. This is a problem that I’ve been facing for a long time, and I hope the course can give me the answer. </p>

            <p>I just had my <u>third</u> python class and we were still talking about the List. The reason I’m now writing this blog is because for the first time, I have been in the “flow” that I truly and completely sink in to the process of creating code, finding errors and trying to fix it. This was led by an after-class homework assigned to us for this class that we were asked to create a program which contains certain functions. </p>
<hr>
<p>I used around 20 minutes to figure it out and submit the first version. However, it was imperfect according to the teacher and he gave me some advices for improvement. Unfortunately, I failed to create the right program after numerous tries. During this process, I have been adjusting different part of the program while checking the content in the textbook. When these didn’t work, I seeked out for help.</p>
<p>​                                                                <em>(class discussion)</em> </p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/16p16U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/02/06/16p16U.md.png" alt="16p16U.md.png"></a></p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a lot of my classmates were enfacing the same problem as I. Consequently we started a class discussion even when it was already an hour later the end of class. Our teacher also joined after a while and with his aid I addresses the problem quickly and I was genuinely  happy when I saw the expected output. I then shared my result in the chat and tried to answer questions from others. I was so into the process of solving problem that I didn’t even realize the pass of time. </p>
<p>​                                        <em>(the program we were trying to building)</em></p>

<p>Now, I can understand why there are tons of internet worker who are willing to spend their whole day staring at their screen just for solving the bug. I can now admit, that coding is <strong>addictive</strong>. It is <strong>interesting</strong> and I wish it would be my new interest to establish further.</p>

            <p>I just had my first Python online class and I just want to quickly record this as believe the journey of learning this new coding language will be playing a pivotal role in my future learning.</p>
<h4 id="How-I-felt-before-class"><a href="#How-I-felt-before-class" class="headerlink" title="How I felt before class:"></a>How I felt before class:</h4><p>I wouldn’t say I’m an experienced code writer nor a beginner. Yes, I do have experience which I gained from the previous digital design/computer science classes in school but as I am not a technology enthusiasm, I didn’t input other time outside of class. Hence, I felt ensure about my ability on entering the course even after the research I did that told me Python is a language with low threshold and accessible, especially when the class has already reached chapter 4 according to the textbook. However, as this is a new experience of learning to me, curiosity and freshness have also been taken to the class.</p>
<h4 id="What-we-learned-in-class"><a href="#What-we-learned-in-class" class="headerlink" title="What we learned in class:"></a>What we learned in class:</h4><p>This class covered all the content of the usage lists, including the list data type, the index, getting a list’s length, etc.</p>

<h4 id="How-I-felt-after-class"><a href="#How-I-felt-after-class" class="headerlink" title="How I felt after class:"></a>How I felt after class:</h4><p>The first sensation I have is the feeling of proud. I was proud of myself because I found myself being able to catch up with the class, understanding the concept, and outputting them on my laptop. This plus the compliment I received in class gave me motivation to do further exploration on coding. Beside, I seem to sense the fun part of coding and I wish this feeling would increase in the future with the progress of my study.</p>
<p>My current plan and goal is to focus on building the understanding of the foundation of Python by re-taking my missed class of chapter 1-3. Extracting information from the lessons maximumly in order to pave a better road for future learning. </p>
