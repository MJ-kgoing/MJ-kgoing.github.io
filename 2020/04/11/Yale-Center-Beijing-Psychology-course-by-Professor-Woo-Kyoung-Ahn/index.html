<p>This course of the psychology department of Yale University is known as one of the most popular course in the university that there are more than 500 students attending every time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a course about thinking and reasoning using psychology, and will also discuss how can you improve your thinking skills. Covered topics include judgment and decision making, causal learning, logical reasoning, problem solving, creativity, intelligence, moral reasoning, and language and thought.</p>
<p>I wish this course can bring actual help and change to students’ daily life.</p>
<p> —— Professor Woo-Kyoung Ahn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one I attended this time is only a 4 x 90min session of the course which is splitted into two days, covering behavioral economics, self-concept, planning and optimism bias, thinking about others and fake news.</p>
<p>The course is introduced by the Yale Center Beijing institution and is taught online due to the Covid-19.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor of Psychology</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ph.D., 1990, University of Illinois</p>
<p>My main area of research interest is higher-level reasoning processes. In particular, I study how people learn and represent concepts and causal relations, and how causal explanations shape our thinking processes. I study basic cognitive processes underlying concept and causal learning. I also study applied issues, such as how expert clinicians’ causal explanations for mental disorders affect their diagnoses, and how learning about one’s genetic predisposition affects people’s expectations about their symptoms.</p>
<p>—— Department of Psychology of Yale University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After attended the course I would say Professor Ahn is a lecturer who is experienced, amiable, and is good at conveying informations in an easily understandable way. Her lectures are very informative but also interactive as there are many quizes and polls that keep us engaged. Another thing I really appreciate is the relaxing atmosphere Prof. Ahn creates in her class that she constantly use light tones while speaking and put entertaining video clips between concepts.</p>

<p>– Misjudgement of Utility</p>
<p>– Misjudgement of probability </p>

<li><p><strong><u>What are the concepts that are memorable to me?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winning 1 million or loss your legs doesn’t really make a difference on life satisfaction according to Focusing  Illusion.</li>
<li>We got to be chill more, being too rational isn’t always a good thing.</li>
<li>It is possible for us to believe we are above the average while feeling insecure due to the Above Average Effect and the high standard we set for ourselves.</li>
<li>We often estimate a shorter time than the actual time we need to complete a task which is know as the Planning Fallacy. In addition, making a detailed plan wouldn’t help but do the the opposite. However, using a 3rd person perspective would help us to focus more on the obsticles more instead of believing things will go smoothly.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><u><strong>What did we go through?</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Theory of Mind</u></p>
<p>– Deficit in Theory of mind of Children</p>
<p>– Deficit in Theory of mind of Adult</p>
<p>– Reasons why we are having difficulty in mind-reading</p>
</li>
<li><p><u>Fake News</u></p>
<p>– Why do people fall for fake news?</p>
<p>– How can we prevent it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong><u>What are the concepts that are memorable to me?</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t really help when you put yourself into others’ shoes in order to understand their opinion better, therefore the best way to know what people are thinking is to ask them directly.</li>
<li>It seems that because Eastern people are collective rather than idividualistic, they tend to be better at considering others’ perspective.</li>
<li>Even children’s memory can be changed by themselves with or without leading questions, and there are cases in the world in which innocent people are accused to be child abuser with the the unrealistic memory kids have.</li>
<li>Simply by repeating a statement we can make others believe in it, even when the statement is not true.</li>
<li>It is important to check whether the resources you are using have a fake consensus.</li>
<li>Denying the fake news is not enough, the best way to eliminate a fake news is to prove it wrong and replace it with a correct information.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><u>Psychology is a branch of science</u></p>
<p>During the course, especially on the Behavioral Economic section, a lot of calculation were done in order to support the theory and visualize the concept. Maths and the ability to analyze data are also required in designing and evaluating experiments. In other words, all the conclusion we got about human’s mind are the production of rational calculation and analysis. This enhanced my idea on working hard on those skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><u>Lecture is very different from regular classes in school</u></p>
<p>This is my first time to attend a lecture given by an actual professor from university, therefore it took me sometime to adapt to the rhythm of the course. In this lecture the professor went through the concepts in a relatively fast speed which was different from the teachers in school who would stop and answer questions during class. Consequently, I found some difficult in taking notes as I was not sure whether I should just focus on what the professor was talking or taking note at the same time. If I did the latter, then which were the important part that I needed to write down with the limited time. I believe these are the questions I need to answer in order to have a better experience for the next similar situation in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p><u>It is always useful to learn some psychology</u></p>
<p>Psychology can help you understand the relationship between the individual and the society, yourself and others better, thus save your time from thinking too much about your social life or other situations happen aroung you. Psychology also helps you to think and evaluate critically, which are the abilities required basically in every field.</p>
